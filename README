Servers installer supports now ARM arch raspbrry PI

It's always the same in Linux: To make it work on your system, some quake2 
stuff needs to be compiled. Please follow these simple instructions.

First, on Linux, be an unprivileged user. The following will create a
"aq2-server" directory, so, there is no need to create a new directory.
Just start the the magic script by:


Q: But, what do they really do?
A: In fact, those two magic scripts are just a shortcut for the following steps:

  git clone https://github.com/stan0x/aq2-server.git  
  or 
  git pull # if the files already exist

  cd aq2-server/q2compile
  
  
  ./make_and_put_all.sh clean
  or 
  ./make_and_put_all.sh update


===============================================================================
Now, to YOUR JOB! Your job is to configure your server, so read the
following steps carefully and learn something.
===============================================================================

ABOUT THE ACTION QUAKE 2 MOD CONFIGURATION:
-------------------------------------------

Change to your q2 server action directory:

  cd aq2-server/q2srv/action/


There, you have to edit your configuration files, and set your stuff up.

See which cfg files are there:

  ls -1 *cfg   


Edit h_passwords.cfg so you have a rcon_password that you actually know:

  nano h_passwords.cfg


Edit aq2_1.cfg, aq2_2.cfg etc so you have a nice hostname etc.

  nano aq2_1.cfg
  etc.


For information about AQ2-TNG Mod settings inside those configuration files, 
see the documentation inside the docs/ directory!!

Inside the h_admin/ directory are admin helper scripts. With those little 
scripts you can get additional maps or update your soundlist.ini.

This will install cloud.bsp and update your maplist (config/maplist.ini):
  
  ./getmap.sh cloud


For a public server which is more fun ;), put your user wave files into 
action/sound/user/. And then, to update your soundlist (config/soundlist.ini)
goto action/h_admin/ and do:

  ./make_sndlist.sh



ABOUT GS STARTER:
-----------------

Change to your q2 server directory:

  cd aq2-server/q2srv/


Edit the gs_starter.cfg and try to study what it says:

  nano gs_starter.cfg 

  Note: The ACTIVATE variable defines which instances get run 
        by ./gs_starter.sh startwatch. And obviously, the rest of the 
        variables define starting parameters for these instances.


Start the gs_starter.sh script... With default gs_starter.cfg, it will watch 
over your Action Quake 2 game server instances 1, 2 and 3:

  screen ./gs_starter.sh startwatch


IT'S DONE. YOU'RE READY TO GO!
But if you're new to Linux and "screen", you have to read "ABOUT SCREEN".


You can kill ALL instances with:

  ./gs_starter.sh stopall
  Note: If they were watched by startwatch, the instances will come up again.


You can kill an instance X with:

  ./gs_starter.sh stop X
  Note: If it was watched by startwatch, the instance will come up again.


You can start an instance X with:

  ./gs_starter.sh start X
  Note: This does not necessarily mean that this instance is watched.


You can stop watching the instances with:

  ./gs_starter.sh stopwatch


For help, just start it:

  ./gs_starter.sh


ABOUT SCREEN:
-------------

You can get a list of running gameserver instances with:

  screen -ls


You can attach to a running gameserver instance with:

  screen -x gs1
  or
  screen -x gs2   etc.


You can detach from a gameserver instance with:

  Press  ctrl+a  then  press d



And now, have fun!
